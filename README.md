# Prosjekt - PROG2053

## Installation notes: 
- Install nodeJs
- Run "npm i" in both the server and client folders of the project.    
- While in the root folder of the project: "docker-compose up -d" - this will take a long time the first time you do it.
- Are you getting an error after doing "docker-compose up -d", saying "[...] Filesharing has been cancelled"? 
-> Go to Docker for Windows app (or similar) -> Settings -> Resources -> File sharing -> Add all your drives (or play around with figuring out what exactly you need).
- Are you getting an error saying "npm ERR! ch() never called"? 
-> Delete "package-lock.json" from the client directory, then build the client again using "docker-compose build client"

Want to reset your containers and volumes fully? 
- "docker system prune -a --volumes"

Want to get in to a container for some reason?
